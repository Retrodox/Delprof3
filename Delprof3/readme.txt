Deletes all profiles besides ones you specifed and the one you are currently signed in on along with the default file.

Also deletes the registry key items located under Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList\ 
for the profiles marked for deletion

Use with caution and always make a backup if you don't trust my script.. 
I am not responsible for you messing up and deleting someones profile due to some silly typo. Thats on you bro.
